# Mental Well-Being Signal Detection from Social Media

## Overview
This project aims to detect implicit mental well-being signals from public social media text using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
The focus is on identifying subtle linguistic patterns rather than explicit mental health keywords.

## Data Sources
- Twitter (public English tweets)
- Reddit (public posts – planned)

## Ethical Considerations
- Only publicly available data is used
- No user identifiers are stored
- Analysis is performed at an aggregate level
- This project does NOT attempt diagnosis

## Current Stage:
- Project setup
- Twitter API integration (limited by API rate limits)
- Query design for implicit mental health signals

## Next Steps:
- Stable data collection
- Text preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
